## About the Specification

Agent Skills is an open standard for creating modular, self-contained packages that extend AI agent capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools.

The specification covers:
- File structure and naming conventions
- YAML frontmatter requirements
- Progressive disclosure system
- Bundled resources (scripts, references, assets)
- Security considerations
- Best practices

## Why an Open Standard?

Like MCP (Model Context Protocol), Agent Skills is designed to be portable across AI platforms. Skills created following this specification should work whether you're using Claude or other AI systems that support the standard.

## Contributing to the Standard

The Agent Skills standard is maintained by Anthropic in collaboration with members of the AI ecosystem. To contribute or provide feedback, visit:
